The intrinsic motivation factor toward online education is can be defined as internal energy coming from individualistic base that support interest, self-requirement, self determination, self-regulation and autonomy of learning. Extrinsic can be defined as external factor that stimulate learners and these factor can be behaviours of teacher or lecturer, learning topic, learning teaching strategies, teaching-learning process, interaction between students and lecturers and so on.</blockquote>


<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: century;">Development of <abbr tittle="Information and Communication Technologies">ICT</abbr> leads to major changes in learning-teaching environtment. Both ICT and internet have been important as contemporary educational changes and they support more flexible, more electronically distributed, more open and more learner controller forms of learning.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: century;">My intrinsic motivation toward online education is I set my mind about online learning is something new and it easier method eventhough sometimes i faced a few challenges like internet connection problem. I also need to focus on learning education to ensure I can get the info from lecturer and get excellent result for that particular semester.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: century;">My extrinsic motivation toward online education is learning-teaching process, participation and attention and online learning environment or technical infastructure. Efficient learning-teaching process can encourage me to more interested in education online because student and lecturer have freedom to discuss and giving feedback or correction immediately. The participation and attention from all class members also can increase my motivation toward online classes when we interact each other by giving ideas or opinion about lesson.The last one is online learning environment or technical infrastructure also important because without that facility we cant join online classes perfectly and it will make frustrated.
